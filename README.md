# Py3Direct
Redirection tools from Python 2 docs to Python 3 docs

###Bookmarklet
Create a new bookmark and paste the code into the "Location" or "URL" field.
If you find yourself on Python 2 documentation, click the bookmark and you will 
be redirected to the same page in the Python 3 documentation.

###Extensible Bookmarklet
Py3Direct use is preloaded, as well as a convenient way to bypass Youtube sign-in for mature content.
You can easily add more redirection rules as needed.

###Userscript
Install into Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey to be automatically redirected from Python 2 documentation to the same page in Python 3 documentation.
